# Problem Statement
Terraform needs multiple steps to apply successfully.  Plan should be executed before an apply and the output of the plan should be used in order to ensure that the approved plan is what is applied.  Not using the plan output could result in unintended consequences.  The file generated by the plan also contains secrets and this file needs to be saved in a secure area and not as a GitHub artifact.

It is possible that even upon a successful plan that an apply fails.  Given that a PR should not be merged into the main branch until it has been successfully applied to the given environment.  Only after an apply is the desired state configuration the actual configuration.
